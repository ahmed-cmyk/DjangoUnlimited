        <h3><b>How do I place an ad?</b></h3>
        <p>It's very easy to place an ad: click on the button "Post free Ads" above right.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>What does it cost to advertise?</b></h3>
        <p>The publication is 100% free throughout the website.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>If I post an ad, will I also get more spam e-mails?</b></h3>

        <br>
        <h3><b>How long will my ad remain on the website?</b></h3>
        <p>In general, an ad is automatically deactivated from the website after 3 months. You will receive an email a week
            before D-Day and another on the day of deactivation. You have the ability to put them online in the following
            month
            by logging into your account on the site. After this delay, your ad will be automatically removed permanently
            from
            the website.</p>
